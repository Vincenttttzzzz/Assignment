Books & Rooms

Project Overview

Books & Rooms is a bookstore which provides a variety of books for visitors to choose from. It also has rooms which visitors can book providing more comfortability for users to indulge in their stories.

Design Process

This website is designed for users who want to go to the bookstore and book their desired rooms to elevate their reading experience as well as enjoy the services that the bookstore has for the visitors. With this website, visitors can book rooms and rent books that they want to read ahead of time in order to avoid the rooms being unavailable. Thus, visitors will not need to personally visit the bookstore for bookings and rentings which provides more convenience for the users.

- As a visitor, I want to book rooms through the website, so that the room will be available when I visit the book store.
- As a visitor, I want to rent books through the website, so that the books I want to read will be available.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to see the various locations of the bookstore, so that I can identify the nearest one and understand the directions to reach it.
- As a book uenthsiast, I want to find a comfortable room to read in, so that I am able to relax while immerse myself in the stories.
- As a reader, I want to find books that are on sale in the bookstore online, so that I do not need to buy from the physical bookstore.
